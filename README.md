# Simon 
Based on the popular Milton Bradley game, Simon is a memory game where the player has to repeat a random and ever growing sequence of button presses, without making a mistake. In this version, I expanded beyond the orginal 4 lights, and include a medium and impossible difficulty that increase the speed and number of possible buttons 


The purpose of this project was to utilize javascript, CSS, and HTML skills to build a playable game from scratch. In order to do that, I needed to:

    1. Create a user interface
    2. Create a random sequence generator
    3. Create logic to populate the buttons for each of the difficulty levels
    4. Create button blinking animation
    5. Create a way of timing the intervals of the button blinks, as well as a way to make the interval differ at different difficulties
    6. A score keeping system



## Built With
